I have a diverse background in the hospitality industry, with a specialization in management and business development. As my career progressed, I became increasingly involved in operational optimization and development. This experience sparked a growing interest in leveraging data to quantify and solve complex business challenges. So I studies in Data Science and transitioned into the role of a Data Analyst/ Data Scientist!
